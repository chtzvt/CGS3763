Producer-Consumer Results With 1000 Iteration Loop Delay

There's not much of a difference between the output of the busy wait version (where the global variable busywait_amount is set to 1000) and a version with no delay set.

An interesting note- My very first version of the code only had two semaphores, Full and Empty. I had trouble with the program output getting mangled by concurrent outputs from both the producer and consumer because of the Mutex semaphore, which protects the critical sections of both the producer and consumer (and thus their ability to write to stdout).
