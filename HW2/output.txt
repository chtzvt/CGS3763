Homework #2 Concurrency and I/O Subsystem

As you can see below, the program runs correctly and produces the expected output
from each component of the I/O subsystem. I included an exit message in each component
to demonstrate that certain coroutines terminate more quickly than others. This is
because they have fewer contingencies (for example, DOIO).
